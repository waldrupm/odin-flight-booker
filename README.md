## What is the goal of this project?

The project is completed inline with the [Odin Flight Booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker) project.

The goal of this project is to build a flight booking app using Ruby on Rails, specifically building up skills around the use of advanced forms and associations.
This will use join tables and nested forms, as well as the use of scopes, validations, and search functionality.

Some of the Rails features I believe I'll be using (I'm writing this before starting) are:
 - accepts_nested_attributes_for
 - has_many through
 - collection_select
 - A bit of Turbo or Stimulus to handle the dynamic form elements (maybe, time permitting)
 - TailwindCSS for styling
 - Turbo Streams to push updated flight times to the user (maybe, time permitting)
 - Search functionality for flights, maybe getting as far as a query builder (maybe, time permitting)
